      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>RTP STEM 4 Youth strives for better education to underserved youth who feel they need a boost in their learning. We give our students a chance to interpret and understand science in a different way – creatively. We believe that understanding science in this way would be beneficial to all careers. We support these professional journeys that our students and volunteers may choose to pursue, regardless of whether it falls under the STEM umbrella. We teach high school students how to lead, organize a club, and channel their passion for science in a positive way that helps their local communities. These high school students then interactively show elementary school students what science is about – innovation and creativity – giving the elementary school students fun, lasting memories of how science affects their world. Through this student-led structure, our 501(c)3 has already spread this new way of learning science to over 10 states. If you have any questions or comments, email us at abhinav@stem4youth.com</p>
      <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
      <p>Our senior leadership is by students, for students. High school students from North Carolina who have gotten offers from Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Yale, and Harvard, collaborate to design content, raise funds, and teach programs.
